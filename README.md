Professional demonstration of enterprise iOS device management capabilities using Jamf Now MDM platform for Help Desk and IT support roles.

## Overview

This lab demonstrates comprehensive iOS Mobile Device Management (MDM) configuration and administration skills essential for modern IT support roles. The project showcases real-world enterprise scenarios where Help Desk professionals must manage, secure, and troubleshoot iOS devices across different user roles and security requirements. Using Jamf Now as the cloud-based MDM platform, this lab covers device enrollment, profile management, security policy enforcement, and systematic troubleshooting methodologies that directly apply to corporate IT environments.

## Lab Architecture

The lab environment consists of a cloud-based management infrastructure using Jamf Now MDM platform to centrally control and monitor a fleet of iOS devices. The setup includes three physical iPhone devices configured with distinct security profiles representing different enterprise user roles: Executive (high security), Sales (moderate security), and Field Tech (basic security). Each device demonstrates specific use cases and security requirements commonly encountered in corporate environments, including passcode policies, application restrictions, network configurations, and remote management capabilities.

*Device enrollment workflow and management interface*

### Step-by-Step Device Enrollment Process

**Administrator Side (Jamf Now Web Portal):**

1. **Access Jamf Now Portal**: Log into your Jamf Now account at the web portal
2. **Navigate to Devices**: Click on "Devices" in the left sidebar navigation menu
3. **Create Enrollment**: Select "Enroll Device" option to create a new device enrollment
4. **Download Configuration**: Generate and download the configuration profile file (.mobileconfig)

**Device Delivery Method:**

5. **Send to Device**: For lab purposes, email the .mobileconfig file directly to the target iPhone
   - *Note: In production environments, consider using more secure delivery methods*

**User Side (iPhone Device):**

6. **Open Email**: On the target iPhone, open the email containing the configuration file
7. **Install Profile**: Tap on the .mobileconfig attachment - it should automatically prompt for installation
8. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to iPhone Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
9. **Select Profile**: Under "Downloaded Profile" section, tap on "Mobile Device Management"
10. **Install Configuration**: 
    - Tap "Install" button
    - Enter device passcode if prompted
    - Tap "Install" again to confirm
11. **Establish Trust**: Tap "Trust" to establish the management relationship
12. **Complete Installation**: The profile will install and enable remote management capabilities

**Verification Steps:**

13. **Return to Portal**: Go back to the Jamf Now web portal
14. **Refresh Device List**: Navigate to the Devices page and refresh the browser
15. **Confirm Connection**: The newly enrolled device should now appear in the device inventory
16. **Verify Management**: Administrator can now remotely manage, configure, and monitor the device

*Upon successful installation and trust establishment, this configuration file enables comprehensive remote administration permissions for the IT administrator.*

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Symptom | Solution | Time to Resolve |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Device won't enroll | Enrollment code expired | Generated new code within 15-min window | 2 minutes |
| WiFi profile fails | Old profile conflict | Removed previous profiles first | 3 minutes |
| Policy not enforcing | Sync delay | Waited 5 min for policy refresh | 5 minutes |
| Device shows "Lost" | User deleted MDM profile | Re-enrolled device with new code | 5 minutes |
| App won't install | Insufficient storage | Guided user to clear space | 4 minutes |
| VPN connection fails | Certificate expired | Updated certificate in profile | 6 minutes |
